The user initiates a conversation with the AI, asking for a business strategy for sports. The AI responds by requesting more specific information about the user's goals, target sport, target audience, current situation, and the competitive landscape. After the user specifies that they want to teach sports, the AI provides a detailed outline covering value proposition, target market, services offered, marketing, operations, finances, and competitive advantages, tailored to the "teaching sports" concept, and again asks for clarification on the specific sport, ideal student, and current experience.
