The user wants to make money teaching sports (specifically badminton) and is open to teaching "whoever wants to learn". The AI is trying to provide tailored advice but emphasizes that it needs specific information to do so effectively. The AI has pressed the user multiple times to provide their location, whether they have access to facilities/equipment, and more detail about who they want to teach. It can only offer generalized ideas without this key information and asks the user to specify a target demographic within children and teens.
